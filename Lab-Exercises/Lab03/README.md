# The Workflow - Lab Outline
## COAP
+ We tried to install COAP
+ This took us some time, we would always get some errors
+ Finally found out we used the wrong clientID
+ After that we tried to adjust a LED with the Arduino code below
+ There were no problems because we used the example and changed a few lines to get this to work

### Here is how the COAP Example looked like

## MQTT
+ We were stuck very long on this task
+ We didn't really know how mqtt works so we had to read into it
+ At first we thought we need to implement the chat system in java so we programmed mqtt in java, but it didn't really work
+ After we installed we couldn't connect to our raspberry pi because we configured something wrong (we don't really know what we changed but it works now)
+ We made the sensor simulators in Java (we had some experience after our chat misunderstanding)
