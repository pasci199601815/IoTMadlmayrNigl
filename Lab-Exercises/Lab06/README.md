# The Workflow - Lab Outline
+ Ulrich flashed our dongle on a WEMOS and 2 other esp's with the pre_flash
+ we researched the doku a bit and then tried to adobt our first node
+ this worked fine for the first one
+ we didn't realise at first that we need to create new folder for new nodes so we struggled a bit to flash the second esp
+ after that we got some problems with deploying so we worked with ssh and not the dashboard (help from Ulrich)
+ we created the swtich with the onboard led (quiet easy because the demo example already does this but we recreated it for our second node)
+ we then tried the rgb, at first we had some problems because we didn't read the doku precisely so we always talked to the wrong node in mqtt
+ for the acoustic distanc sensor we to build an voltage divider, so we needed some resistors from Ulrich (and some help)
+ the buzzer alarm worked without problems
