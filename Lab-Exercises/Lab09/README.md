# The Workflow - Lab Outline
 - Continue and finish project 1
 - Connect your Node-Red to other team's node-red via ulno.net
(topic iot2019/UniqueMergeTeamName), exchange sensor data
- ESP-Now
– Use unicast examples from https://github.com/yoursunny/WifiEspNow in
platform.io or Arduino IDE (no IoTempower yet in this task)
– Build a connection tester for ESP-Now (two nodes/esp8266 sending
numbered packages to each other), check how many are dropped.
– Leave one in lab, take other one around campus
– Check how far you can still transfer data (and in which direction) – if you
have already a big team (for final project), you can do this task only once
per big team (maybe with another node to speed up test)



After setting up the portable one:

We left the lab went outside:

The connection still worked so went went further away

When the distance reached ~60-70 m the connection finally went spotty.
