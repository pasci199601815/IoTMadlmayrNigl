# Story - hydroponic container Scenario
+ Weather and air in big cities.
+ Air pollution
+ Weather “forecast”
+ Humidity and temperature
All of the above for monitoring your greenhouse, if the plants need to get watered, if there is too much CO2 in the air and the plants should not get access to open air. If the temperature is too high and the blinds should keep the sun out…
Actors: Jane, Peter
It is early in the morning on a sunny day in the city of Chicago. Jane wakes up, makes herself a cup of coffee and starts her morning rituals. Meanwhile, her greenhouse is already up and working, in fact, it never sleeps. It measures humidity and checks on the weather forecast. It calculates how much water the plants need, so they receive the right amount, not too much and not too little. This data can be changed, based on the kind of plants in the greenhouse. Next, it prepares the water and fills the tube, throughout the day the tube gets emptied bit by bit, as controlled through a device. While the water amount is prepared, a CO2 Sensor repeatedly checks if the windows can be left open or if they need to be closed. If they get closed, the ventilation is turned on, so there is some air movement in the room. While the room is closed of, the greenhouse is still exposed to the CO2 heavy air. A brightness sensor measures the brightness of the sun throughout the day and if the sun is too bright, it gives a signal to a servo motor. Some special blinds, that don’t block the sunlight rather they distort it, are being pushed down and protect the soil and plants from drying up. After several weeks or month, based on the growing period of the plant, Jane is getting a notification, to check on her plants if they are ready to be harvested.

Meanwhile on the other side of the world Peter is getting ready to go to bed. He is on his couch and reading up on the latest sport news from the day. The light sensor is checking if the build in artificial light needs to be turned on. His greenhouse temperature sensor is checking the temperature and notices that it’s getting colder. As the temperature passes a particular threshold the windows to Peters apartment closes so the plants don’t get a coldsnap. Throughout the night, the temperature gets checked every now and then to see, if the heater needs to be turned on. Every day at a specific time, the system checks the soil, if it needs fertilizer and if so, Peter gets a notification that some action is needed.
