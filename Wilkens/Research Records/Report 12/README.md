## Failed IoT Projects:
+ Pebble - Smart Watches
+ Vital Herd - Cattle tracking Sensor
+ Yoics - IoT cloud platform

## Challenges:
+ Big IoT can push you out from the market.
+ Have to focus on a niche area to stay in the game.

## Pitch our own Project:
+ Greenhouses for your own Home, so you don't need to have a garden.
+ We provide a greenhouse, wich checks the humidity, temperature and brightness, so your plants of choice can grow without any problems
+ -Its something, that everbody can do it themselves
+ -Might not be needed, if you don't live in a big city
+ +We provide a ready to use opportunity, just set it up and its ready to use.
+ +Live a healthy livestyle with your own Greenhouse
+ +Humans are lazy, this project can take a lot of work from you shoulders
