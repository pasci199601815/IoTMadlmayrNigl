## Scaling and Testing
The more system, the more work you have to do to build the system and maintain it
The time to manage the system also rises
The equipment should always work, also some more personnel would be good, so there are more people to ask questions and dont have to wait for a (long) while

With a stroy scenario everybody should know what they should do or what the final task is
For testing, there could some bulletpoints, what die device should do and before doing the next task you have to check if all the bulletpoints work.
MQTT could help handle data management. standard Definition and Security


## IoT Frameworks(1)
### What are the key challenges of IoT and why?
+	Connectivity is not reliable, latency of cennectivity is significant
### What is/are the generic solution(s) for it?
+	Many Standards are avaible
+	Hybrid Integration Patterns
### Two examples for used patterns.
+	Connectors, Process Design Tools (together: integration Processes)
+	Hybrid Integration Platform Capability Framework
### Definition/relation of cloud, edge, fog.
+	Fog Computing: Note always communication on the cloud, more device to device communication
### Two advantages of edge/fog computing.
+	local controll, traffic

## IoT Frameworks(2)
### What are the different categories of the presented frameworks?
+	Dataflow pipeline, Stream processing, Process engine
### What are the main features of each category?
+	Troughput, flowing window
