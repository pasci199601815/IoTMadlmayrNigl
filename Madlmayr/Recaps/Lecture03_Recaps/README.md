# Recap:
## What was part of Lecture 03:
- Researching text types and JSON + YAML

### Wrapping it up and own thoughts (Reflection):
After comparing our results I came to the conclusion that YAML is inherently superior to JSON, but XML, JSON are still broadly used
## What was part of Lab 3:
- Uaing CoAP and a Chrome Extension to toggle an inbuilt ESP8622 LED with http put requests
- using MQTT.fx


### Wrapping it up and own thoughts (Reflection):
+ Big lab exercices, sometimes overwhelming when working first time with some technologys
+ not enough time, using 4th lab for it again
+ Fun to work in groups
