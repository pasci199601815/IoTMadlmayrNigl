# Recap:
## What was part of Lecture 1?
* Brief introduction of topic and the professor
* Dove further into what makes IoT special and its usecases
* Doing self-research about IoT after watching a short video
* Formed groups for the Lab
* Got presented some nifty toys

### Wrapping it up and own thoughts (Reflection):
The Idea of flipping the common lecture style sounds very interesting and helps to get a better grasp as you have to do research for yourself. I also liked that we saw some tools and toys at the end of the lecture. Although it is currently still a bit unclear on how the repository and its contents should look like, I am sure that the confusion will fade during the next session.

## What was part of Lab 1?
* got handed out the tools
* made an server and client (both esp8266)
* client sends a HTTP GET request per buttonpress, server toggles LED

### Wrapping it up and own thoughts (Reflection):
First we had some difficulties, because our board was not soldered, after that was fixed by Ulrich, we started to implement the logic with two Arduino programs.
Then it was pretty straightforward.
