# Recap
+ We started with our idea for project 2, and how to structure the video
+ Our 5 man team got completed with Anna Spiegelmayr and Micheal Wachlhofer
+ They helped us with the remaining lab tasks, like flogo and the led strips and we , in turn , helped them with iotempower tasks
+ as Final Resume I can gladly state that I very much enjoyed this module - IoT. It gave me an insight into the evergrowing world of the internet of things and building something ourselves was both challenging but also very fun.
+ I also enjoyed the projects as a challenge to create scenarios for real world applications of our newly collected knowledge
+ the video duration seems to be quite a challenge, but we are positiv that we amount enough content to reach the treshold
