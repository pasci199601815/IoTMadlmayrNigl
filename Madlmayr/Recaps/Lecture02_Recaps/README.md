# Recap:
## What was part of Lecture 02:
- Researching about Cloud-, Edge- and Fog-computing
- looking up low Level buses (i got SPI)
- I got to know new low level buses in team work

### Wrapping it up and own thoughts (Reflection):
Self-Researching the topics and comparing them in teams of 5 was very useful to collect information.

## What was part of Lab 2:
- Setting up an ESP8266 with an button to trigger a IFTTT Webhooks -> Telegram routine
- Powering the I2C and displaying custom messages.
  * We used an address check to confirm the address of the display (0x27)
  * We then displayed messages onto the display with the I2C Display library
- Instead of using the Webhooks library we hardcoded the POST Request
- It worked after realising we need to refresh in the IFTTT- Interface (check now Button)


### Wrapping it up and own thoughts (Reflection):
+ Big lab exercices, sometimes overwhelming when working first time with some technologys
+ Interesting new Topics
+ Get lots of informations out of one exercise
+ Still sometimes confusing what to do or how to do it but better then last time
+ Fun to work in groups
