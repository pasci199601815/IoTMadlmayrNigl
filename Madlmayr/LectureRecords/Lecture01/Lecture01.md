# Who are you?

## What type of programming experience?
* Java
* Kotlin
* Ionic
* C++
*C

## What have you done with micro controllers, which ones have you used? (Like Arduino, ESP8266, Particle/Photon)?
In terms of dealing with micro controllers I am pretty unexperienced as of now, the only time I dealt with micro controllers was with a Texas Instruments MSP-432 in 4th Semester (Hardwarenahe Programmierung).

## Which single board computers do you know/have you used (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Beaglebone, Labrador)? 
Until now, I haven’t used one of those (neither others).

## Who is a maker or part of a maker community? What do you like, would you like about it? How could it relate to this class?
Someone who finds new use cases for already existing hardware or modifies the hardware to achieve his goals. I find the freedom of creativity inspiring and like the countless different variations IoT can be. I think this class gives us a feeling of how makers work.

## What do you already know about IoT?
I don’t know much IoT but I am willing to learn.

## What are your expectations from this class?
Learn about basics of IoT, what makes it special and how to use hardware correlated to it (e.g. Raspberry Pi).

# IoT in General
## What is IoT?
The internet of things (IoT) is a computing concept that describes the idea of everyday physical objects being connected to the internet and being able to identify themselves to other devices. The term is closely identified with RFID (Near Field Communication NFC) as the method of communication, although it also may include other sensor technologies (pressure, fluid, temperature …) wireless technologies or QR codes.

## Domains:
* mart Homes, Refrigerators
* Wearables, my Smartwatch (Galaxy Watch)
* Power Engagement
* Home Automation
* M2M Communication

## commonly used (data) protocols:
* MQTT: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
* CoAP: Constrained Application Protocol
* Wi-Fi
* Bluetooth (Low Energy)

## What are the Benefits?
* Things we take for granted nowadays, are connected in a way that provides even more value.
* Technology progresses: sensors get smaller, more possible applications
* Scalability
* Automating processes to accelerate and improve themselves

## What are the Challenges?
* Efficiency
* Increasing Complexity
* Margin of Error is pretty small to begin with (even gets smaller)
* Combating solutionism while maintaining healthy innovation

# My Resume:
## What was part of Lecture 1?
* Brief introduction of topic and the professor
* Dove further into what makes IoT special and its usecases
* Doing self-research about IoT after watching a short video
* Formed groups for the Lab
* Got presented some nifty toys
