+ Last but not least: Ulrich was very willing to help us and provided us with hints and clues how to solve most problems that occured during the labs (big thank you!)
## TA (I helped)
+ I helped Micheal Wachlhofer and Anna Spiegelmayr with setting up IOTEmpower

+ I helped Martin Rehrl to document his Coap lab exactly (sent him a picture)

+ I helped Micheal Wachlhofer with calibration the scale and provided the topic names and values for mqtt calibration

+ I helped Martin Rehrl with displaying contents on the I2C-Display

## Video Bewertung
### IOT Vineyard:
+ Most entertaining video

+ very cool intro and outro

+ those noises were a bit overdone, but nice nontheless
### IOT Museum:
+ Audio qualiy not the best

+ Very well made presentation on how the sensors work, especially the alarm sound in FH2 building

+ Sometimes dull
### IOT Fitness:
+ I like the style of having a miniature fitness studio

+ flow of the video provides an oversight on how exactly the product works

+ node red was long but informative
