# Recap
+ The inteview was really interesting, we got a good look into the future of iot and how important it will be into our daily life
+ In the lab we made some plans for our film and assigned everyone some tasks
+ All in all, Ulrich is not a everyday teacher, he had some intersting teaching methods. Sometimes it was not really clear for me what to do but in the end i can say i liked this new style and learned a lot in this course and i am now confident to work with iot.
