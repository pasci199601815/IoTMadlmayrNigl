# Recap
+ We started with our idea for project 2, the video
+ We teamed up with Anna Spiegelmayer and Micheal Wachlhofer
+ They helped us with the remaining lab tasks, like flogo and the led strips and we helped them with iotempire tasks
+ I liked the lecture because we got a look into some interesting Iotprojects and got some inspirations for our project.
+ The video seems a bit long for the project but i think we can fill in enough content
