# IoT-Framework, what would I like to see:

+ Lightweight but at the same time powerful
+ Well documented
+ High security
+ Supports functions like using mqtt
+ Provided test-cases
+ Supports debugging
+ Should be scalable (adjusts for more devices in fog)
+ Competitive price for things offered

# Then we got information about the upcoming first project

+ Followed by a short flogo demo
  - flogo is a very useful albeit confusing tool
+ And now an introduction into the iotempower framework
+ Showed us how to connect parts with platform.io
  - This a ver neat way of handling things
