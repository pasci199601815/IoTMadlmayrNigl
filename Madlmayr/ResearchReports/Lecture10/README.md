# Do individual research on if the Internet of Broken Things is fixable (15min)
## Come up with 3 action points that when addressed will fix the IoBT
+ First, we need more cooperation amongst stakeholders including information sharing within defined boundaries, along with graduated sanctions being in place for rule breakers. The auto industry Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) is one example of this approach that should be replicated in other IoT sectors.

+ Second, we should set standards for IoT devices. One model is the National Institute for Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, along with its work on Cyber-Physical Systems. Over time, these standards could help establish a standard of IoT cybersecurity care, including new approaches to proactive cybersecurity measures.

+ Third, for the time being policymakers should push flexible, guidance-driven frameworks, not prescriptive regulation. Still, a range of policy options are available to incentivize cybersecurity investments, from tax breaks to public bug bounty programs.

## Compared with neighbour and combined results:
+ Costs: less costs than usual approaches
+ Utility: has the potential to provide advantages
+ Competition: much competition , drops the price
+ Longevity: iot devices are durable

## 1 argument for continuing to use and build the Internet of Things
IoT encourages the communication between devices, also famously known as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. Because of this, the physical devices are able to stay connected and hence the total transparency is available with lesser inefficiencies and greater quality.

## Discuss with neighbor (or in groups of 3) and integrate action
points into common list of 7 points, merge arguments

+ Prove my hypotheses wrong: “We should abandon all work with the Internet Of Things and only focus on classics (mobile devices and industrial building automation).”

  - Although IoT needs time to mature it has immense potential and the community driven approach ensures security of libraries and integration is uptodate at any time.
  
## 3 (or more) Sensors we haven’t used:
+ Gyroscope MPU6050/9250
+ RFID-RC522
+ IR receiver (**)
+ Alcohol-Sensor MQ-3
+ Dual color led
+ tilt switch
+ Barometer
