# What is IOT
The internet of things (IoT) is a computing concept that describes the idea of everyday physical objects being connected to the internet and being able to identify themselves to other devices. The term is closely identified with RFID as the method of communication, although it also may include other sensor technologies, wireless technologies or QR codes.
## Domains
+ Healthcare 
+ Voices System
+ Ubiquitous Computing
+ Wearables
## Famous Protocols
+ Node
+ AMQP
## Typical devices
+ Amazon Echo
+ Google Home
+ Arduino Nano
+ https://atap.google.com/jacquard/
## Benefits
+ Everything Connected
+ More Functions when connected
+ Easier Communication
+ Makes life easier (less work)
## Challenges
+ Very Complex
+ Very vulnerable
+ Companies knows (too) much about the costumer
+ Little space for errors 

# What we did
+ Introduction of Professor Ulrich
+ Learned what IOT was, what we should expect about this course
+ Made some research about IOT
+ Watched a short documentary about IOT
+ Formed a group
# Impression
It was a very chaotic first lecture and not the kind of lecture you would normally expect. I like the focus on researching and learning on yourself because I think that’s the best method for remembering all the stuff. With the chaotic nature of the lecture, it was hard to understand what we should hand in after the lecture but I’ll guess this will be more clear after the next few lectures.
