# Impression
It was a very chaotic first lecture and not the kind of lecture you would normally expect. I like the focus on researching and learning on yourself because I think that’s the best method for remembering all the stuff. With the chaotic nature of the lecture, it was hard to understand what we should hand in after the lecture but I’ll guess this will be more clear after the next few lectures.
