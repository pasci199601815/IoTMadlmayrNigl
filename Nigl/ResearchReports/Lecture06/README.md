## write down features you would like to see in an IoT Framework
+ easy to use
+ nice overview
+ good error detection
+ support for most hardware
+ mqtt support
+ good dashboard or node-red
## Research task during demo
### Check covered features (and check off the personal covered features).
IOTEmpore features nice function, for example a pmw function. With pmw you can control everything that needs a frequency as input, for example leds or an alarm. To use it use pmw(node, Output, frequency in int)
### Write down and ask questions (related to realization of own project)
#### Questions
Is there a limit on how many devices it can support and if, how many?
How can we add non-supported sensors?

#### Feature requests
Infrared support
Bluetooth support
Customization of nodes (so maybe you can change more nodes with one call)
