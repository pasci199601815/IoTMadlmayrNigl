# Recap
+ we finished project 1 today and some things from older labs so we are catching up
+ I think there will be a lot of work left for us because we still have the big project, which requieres a 15 min video and, and some labs so i hope we don't get too much flooded with work at the end.
+ I like the group project and the simulation of an real project with a bigger team (with organizing and presenting the idea to our client)
