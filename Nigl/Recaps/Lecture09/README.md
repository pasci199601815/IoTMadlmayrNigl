# Recap
+ slowly our groups seperate in two types: groups that work on the actual lab and then there are groups like us that were a bit overhelmed at the beginning and struggle now to catch up, i hope we don't get to much work at the end and get some time to catch up
+ as always ulrich helped us with some problems so we finished up some old labs
+ iotempower sounds cool and i look forward to solve all the tasks we worked hard on in just one line
