# Recap
+ we finally started to work on project 1
+ compared to lecture 1 I/we seem a lot more confident working with IoT and understanding it so i guess the lecture is working
+ i think this lecture has some really interesting stuff, even when theres a hard start for students that have never really done something with arduino
